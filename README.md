- I'm a Masters student and full-time software engineer, usually in the test automation space. (Currently associate!)
- My areas of interest are software development, test automation & web design. I love cloud and meta stuff, but I dabble :)
- I maintain developer tools and libraries. I have multiple other projects under my belt too.
- Pending patents, I am an inventor in the fields of development tooling, computer vision and test automation.
