- I'm a industrial engineering grad and full-time software engineer, usually in the test automation space.
- My areas of interest are software development, test automation & web design. I love cloud and meta stuff, but I dabble :)
- I maintain developer tools and libraries. I have multiple other projects under my belt too.
- My dream is to be to be an inventor in all the fields of development tooling, computer vision and test automation.
